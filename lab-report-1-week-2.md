## Step 2: Remotely Connecting

For this step, you first need to download OpenSSH by going through the tutorial in the following link: [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)

Go to the following website to obtain your CSE15L account:

[https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

Then, open the console in VScode and type out the following command:

```
ssh cs15lwi22__@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

Fill in the __ with whatever your CSE15L account is that you found from the previous website. After this, it will prompt you to enter your password. After this, you should be logged in.
